            <p>Astronomers estimate that the universe could contain up to one septillion stars - that's a one followed
                by 24
                zeros. Our Milky Way alone contains more than 100 billion, including our most well-studied star, the
                Sun.
            </p>
            <p>Stars are giant balls of hot gas - mostly hydrogen, with some helium and small amounts of other elements.
                Every
                star has its own life cycle, ranging from a few million to trillions of years, and its properties change
                as
                it
                ages.</p>

                <div class="stars-description">
                    <p>Stars form in large clouds of gas and dust called molecular clouds. Molecular clouds range from
                        1,000
                        to
                        10 million times the mass of the Sun and can span as much as hundreds of light-years. Molecular
                        clouds
                        are cold which causes gas to clump, creating high-density pockets. Some of these clumps can
                        collide
                        with
                        each other or collect more matter, strengthening their gravitational force as their mass grows.
                        Eventually, gravity causes some of these clumps to collapse. When this happens, friction causes
                        the
                        material to heat up, which eventually leads to the development of a protostar – a baby star.
                        Batches
                        of
                        stars that have recently formed from molecular clouds are often called stellar clusters, and
                        molecular
                        clouds full of stellar clusters are called stellar nurseries.</p>

                    <p>Astronomers call stars that are stably undergoing nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium main
                        sequence
                        stars. This is the longest phase of a star’s life. The star’s luminosity, size, and temperature
                        will
                        slowly change over millions or billions of years during this phase. Our Sun is roughly midway
                        through
                        its main sequence stage.</p>
                    <p>A star’s gas provides its fuel, and its mass determines how rapidly it runs through its supply,
                        with
                        lower-mass stars burning longer, dimmer, and cooler than very massive stars. More massive stars
                        must
                        burn fuel at a higher rate to generate the energy that keeps them from collapsing under their
                        own
                        weight. Some low-mass stars will shine for trillions of years – longer than the universe has
                        currently
                        existed – while some massive stars will live for only a few million years.</p>

                    <p>At the beginning of the end of a star’s life, its core runs out of hydrogen to convert into
                        helium.
                        The energy produced by fusion creates pressure inside the star that balances gravity’s tendency
                        to
                        pull matter together, so the core starts to collapse. But squeezing the core also increases its
                        temperature and pressure, making the star slowly puff up. However, the details of the late
                        stages of
                        the star’s death depend strongly on its mass.</p>
