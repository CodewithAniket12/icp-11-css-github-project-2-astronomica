        <h1>BLACK HOLES</h1>
        <P>Black holes are among the most mysterious cosmic objects, much studied but not fully understood. These
            objects aren’t really holes. They’re huge concentrations of matter packed into very tiny spaces. A black
            hole is so dense that gravity just beneath its surface, the event horizon, is strong enough that nothing –
            not even light – can escape. The event horizon isn’t a surface like Earth’s or even the Sun’s. It’s a
            boundary that contains all the matter that makes up the black hole.
            There is much we don’t know about black holes, like what matter looks like inside their event horizons.
            However, there is a lot that scientists do know about black holes.</P>

                <h3>01</h3>
                <h4>CLOSEST</h4>
                <P>The nearest known black hole, called Gaia BH1, is about 1,500 light-years away.</P>
            </div>

            <div class="facts-cards">
                <h3>02</h3>
                <h4>Farthest.</h4>
                <P>The most distant black hole detected, at the center of a galaxy called QSO J0313-1806, is around 13
                    billion light-years away.</P>
            </div>

            <div class="facts-cards">
                <h3>03</h3>
                <h4>Biggest.</h4>
                <P>The most massive black hole observed, TON 618, tips the scales at 66 billion times the Sun’s mass.
                </P>
            </div>

            <div class="facts-cards">
                <h3>04</h3>
                <h4>Smallest.</h4>
                <P>The lightest-known black hole is only 3.8 times the Sun’s mass. It’s paired up with a star.</P>
            </div>

            <div class="facts-cards">
                <h3>05</h3>
                <h4>Spaghettification.</h4>
                <P>A real term that describes what happens when matter gets too close to a black hole. It’s squeezed
                    horizontally and stretched vertically, resembling a noodle.</P>
            </div>

            <div class="facts-cards">
                <h3>06</h3>
                <h4>Spin.</h4>
                <P>All black holes spin. The fastest-known – named GRS 1915+105 – clocks in at over 1,000 rotations per
                    second.</P>

                <P>Monster black holes at the centers of galaxies can launch particles to near light speed.</P>

                <h4>Gravity's the same.</h4>
                <P>If you replaced the Sun with a black hole of the same mass, the solar system would get a lot colder,
                    but the planets would stay in their orbits.</P>

                <P>One type of black hole is born when massive stars run out of fuel and explode in supernovae.</P>
